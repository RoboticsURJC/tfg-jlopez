	abstract = {Collaborative robots (cobots) have been increasingly adopted in industries to facilitate human?robot collaboration. Despite this, it is challenging to program cobots for collaborative industrial tasks as the programming has two distinct elements that are difficult to implement: (1) an intuitive element to ensure that the operations of a cobot can be composed or altered dynamically by an operator, and (2) a human-aware element to support cobots in producing flexible and adaptive behaviours dependent on human partners. In this area, some research works have been carried out recently, but there is a lack of a systematic summary on the subject. In this paper, an overview of collaborative industrial scenarios and programming requirements for cobots to implement effective collaboration is given. Then, detailed reviews on cobot programming, which are categorised into communication, optimisation, and learning, are conducted. Additionally, a significant gap between cobot programming implemented in industry and in research is identified, and research that works towards bridging this gap is pinpointed. Finally, the future directions of cobots for industrial collaborative scenarios are outlined, including potential points of extension and improvement.}

	ABSTRACT = {Repairing potholes is a task for municipalities to prevent serious road user injuries and vehicle damage. This study presents a low-cost, high-performance pothole monitoring system to maintain urban roads. The authors developed a methodology based on photogrammetry techniques to predict the pothole’s shape and volume. A collection of overlapping 2D images shot by a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B has been used to create a pothole 3D model. The Raspberry-based configuration has been mounted on an autonomous and remote-controlled robot (developed in the InfraROB European project) to reduce workers’ exposure to live traffic in survey activities and automate the process. The outputs of photogrammetry processing software have been validated through laboratory tests set as ground truth; the trial has been conducted on a tile made of asphalt mixture, reproducing a real pothole. Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) technologies allowed visualising potholes on a map with information about their centre, volume, backfill material, and an associated image. Ten on-site tests validated that the system works in an uncontrolled environment and not only in the laboratory. The results showed that the system is a valuable tool for monitoring road potholes taking into account construction workers’ and road users’ health and safety.},

The EU-funded HERON project will develop an integrated automated system to adequately maintain road infrastructure. In turn, this will reduce accidents, lower maintenance costs, and increase road network capacity and efficiency. To coordinate maintenance works, the project will design an autonomous ground robotic vehicle that will be supported by autonomous drones.

	abstract = {Traditional pothole detection based on two-dimensional images lacks three-dimensional (3D) quantitative information such as depth and volume, although the high accuracy. In addition, existing 3D collection and reconstruction equipment based on depth cameras and lasers are expensive and difficult to operate. To solve the above problems, a low cost and automatic 3D reconstruction and segmentation system for potholes is proposed in this study. The system consists of a pavement pothole Structure-from-motion (PP-SFM) and a 3D point cloud segmentation network for potholes. Firstly, a point cloud reconstruction method called PP-SFM is proposed to reconstruct the easily obtained multi-view 2D potholes images. In addition, to a certain extent, the point cloud sparse problem is solved by the proposed PP-SFM, and the stereo display of potholes is realized. Next, Trans-3D-Seg is developed based on an improved 3D segmentation network modified by the transformer module to ealize effective segmentation of 3D point cloud data of potholes. The accuracy of the improved system is 93.44%, and the F1-score is 92.58%. In addition, the precision-recall (P-R) curve is near the upper right. Comparative experiments show that the proposed system has better segmentation performance. Compared with PointNet++, PointRCNN and PointCNN, the segmentation accuracy are increased by 4.13%, 2.96% and 3.17%, respectively. The F1-score are increased by 2.41%, 2.43% and 2.93%, respectively. The proposed system requires only a few multi-view images taken from ordinary high-definition cameras, which is a high accuracy and low cost method for 3D reconstruction and segmentation of pavement potholes.}

	ABSTRACT = {Potholes, a kind of road defect, can damage vehicles and negatively affect drivers’ safe driving, and in severe cases can lead to traffic accidents. Efficient and preventive management of potholes in a complex road environment plays an important role in securing driver safety. It is also expected to contribute to the prevention of traffic accidents and the smooth flow of traffic. In the past, pothole detection was mainly performed via visual inspection by human experts. Recently, automated pothole-detection methods apply various technologies that converge basic technologies such as sensors and signal processing. The automated pothole-detection methods can be classified into three types according to the technology used in the pothole-recognition process: a vision-based method, a vibration-based method, and a 3D reconstruction-based method. In this paper, three methods are compared, and the strengths and weaknesses of each method are summarized. The detection process and technology proposed in the latest research related to automated pothole detection are described for each method. The development plans of future technology that is connected with those studies are also presented in this paper.},

	ABSTRACT = {Pothole repair is one of the paramount tasks in road maintenance. Effective road surface monitoring is an ongoing challenge to the management agency. The current pothole detection, which is conducted image processing with a manual operation, is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Computer vision offers a mean to automate its visual inspection process using digital imaging, hence, identifying potholes from a series of images. The goal of this study is to apply different YOLO models for pothole detection. Three state-of-the-art object detection frameworks (i.e., YOLOv4, YOLOv4-tiny, and YOLOv5s) are experimented to measure their performance involved in real-time responsiveness and detection accuracy using the image set. The image set is identified by running the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on several deep learning pothole detectors. After collecting a set of 665 images in 720 × 720 pixels resolution that captures various types of potholes on different road surface conditions, the set is divided into training, testing, and validation subsets. A mean average precision at 50% Intersection-over-Union threshold (mAP_0.5) is used to measure the performance of models. The study result shows that the mAP_0.5 of YOLOv4, YOLOv4-tiny, and YOLOv5s are 77.7%, 78.7%, and 74.8%, respectively. It confirms that the YOLOv4-tiny is the best fit model for pothole detection.},

	ABSTRACT = {In order to identify the abnormal road surface condition efficiently and at low cost, a road surface condition recognition method is proposed based on the vibration acceleration generated by a smartphone when the vehicle passes through the abnormal road surface. The improved Gaussian background model is used to extract the features of the abnormal pavement, and the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm is used to distinguish the abnormal pavement types, including pothole and bump. Comparing with the existing works, the influence of vehicles with different suspension characteristics on the detection threshold is studied in this paper, and an adaptive adjustment mechanism based on vehicle speed is proposed. After comparing the field investigation results with the algorithm recognition results, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated. The test results show that the vehicle vibration acceleration contains the road surface condition information, which can be used to identify the abnormal road conditions. The test result shows that the accuracy of the recognition of the road surface pothole is 96.03%, and the accuracy of the road surface bump is 94.12%. The proposed road surface recognition method can be utilized to replace the special patrol vehicle for timely and low-cost road maintenance.},
